# Tic-Tac-Talon

Did you know that Benjamin Franklin originally proposed the United States' national bird to be the turkey? Now is your chance to pit the Turkey and the Bald Eagle against each other in an interactive game of tic-tac-toe!

This project is a culmination of learning goals in module 1 at Turing School of Software & Design. The main points are to demonstrate my understanding of:
- local storage so scores may persist upon refresh
- event delegation to allow the playing board to be interactive
- delegation of work functions complete
- keeping the DOM and the data separate
